DIY 3D printed Illuminator and Penlight for Vixen Great Polaris mount

I recently purchased a Vixen Great Polaris mount.  I really like the mount; it's a major step up from my Edmund medium duty EQ in every way imaginable.  The mount came with a polar scope that has made a world of difference in my set-up time.  Unfortunately, both the illuminator and penlight were missing.  And that pesky Polaris doesn't like to rear his bright head while the Sun is up.

I could have a friend hold a red penlight in front of the polar scope (probably better than aligning your scope with only one hand).  Or better yet, a lighter!

But like many others, I thought buying the illuminator and penlight would be the better way to go.  That was until I found out how much a new one was and how seldom a used one comes up for sale.  So, I decided I needed to make one.

I found a number of forums that included DYI illuminator/penlights that were brilliant for their creativity, resourcefulness, and down-right frugalness.  These "creators" used what they had (the essence of ATM), what they knew, and made something that worked. I decided to take a stab myself; using what I had, what I knew, and hopefully, what would work.

After confirming the last part (what would work), I want to share it with the community that has helped me learn everything I know (which is still very little) about astronomical equipment and observing.  And by sharing I don't mean reading this post.  I mean sharing the STL files.  PM me.  They're free to you.

So here's what I made, and what you can too if you have a 3D printer and a couple electronic components that cost less than a burger and fries.

Material List:

(1) 5mm red LED (1.8 - 2.6V is probably best); and
(1) 3V lithium battery (CR2032)

Other than this, the rest is printed.
Here are the details on the (3) printed components:

Part 1: The illuminator, if you will

SEE 'Part 1.jpg'

This part fits into the polar scope window much like the polar scope cap and/or REAL illuminator.  My part has a hollow section within the cylinder to help illuminate the entire inner circumference of the ring.  The LED fits into the base of the ring, after inserting the LED wires into the next part.

Part 2: The penlight, if you will

SEE 'Part 2.jpg'

The two wires that come out of the LED go into their respective holes in the recessed portion on top.  Make sure to test the wires to determine which one is + and which one is -.  If backwards, your LED will not light up.  The holes guide the wires into position to straddle the top and bottom of the battery (offset to the side so you don't see them) when the battery is pushed upward.  Presto.  You have light.  A tight fit keeps the battery up until you slip it down using your thumb.

Part 3: The...other part I needed when the battery fell out

SEE 'Part 3.jpg'

This part is pretty important.  Once the battery is slipped into Part 2, Part 3 slips in behind the battery.  It keeps the battery from falling out into that area of your dark sky site that eats every little thing that gravity graciously provides it.  Use it.  It's important.

Here are all three parts and a battery in their order of assembly.

And here is my working prototype.

I call it a prototype because I'm eager to get your feedback on ways to improve it.  And I want anyone and everyone who has a Vixen mount without an illuminator/penlight (and a 3D printer) to make one.  That's the spirit of this community and this hobby, right?
